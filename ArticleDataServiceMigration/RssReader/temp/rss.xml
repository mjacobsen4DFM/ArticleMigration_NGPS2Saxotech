            <description><![CDATA[<p>So the lady from the Dollar Tree has been haunting me.</p><p>I met her when my husband and I decided to take what we call "a trip to nowhere" - just a drive to get away for the day, which that day, turned out to be Arvin.</p><p>Never heard of it? Neither had we. Roughly speaking, it is a little over a hundred miles north of Los Angeles and a little southeast of Bakersfield.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Q  I have an uncomfortable and somewhat personal question.  My father-in-law is in his late 80s and has bad breath.  It is difficult to sit next to him at dinners.  I don't feel comfortable discussing this with him.  Is bad breath a normal function of aging and is there some way to approach the topic delicately?</p><p>- L.</p>]]></description>
